    "**Why is it that we identify ourselves at the very beginning of a phone conversation, even to people we already know, but we do not do this when we meet in person? Express your answer within the framework of Bayesian perceptual inference.**  \n",
    "When we are on the phone the only sensory signal we have is the sound of a persons voice, while when we meet in person, we have the sound of the persons voice, but we also have a strong visual signal. There are two ways to thinkg about how introducing yourself over the phone aids in the other persons perceptual inference for who is on the phone. We can either think of it as another obersvation (likelihood) used to make our perceptual inference or we can consider it as prior information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**As an extra source of sensory information**\n",
    "- The auditory cue is ambiguous, especially over the phone, which produces uncertainty on who is you are talking to. Introducing yourself provides another source of information for the receiver to integrate to produce the perceptual inference of who you are.\n",
    "- In person however, there is a very strong visual source of information that would not be very uncertain, and therefore, there is no need to introduce yourself as the person you are meeting has likely already recognized who you are.\n",
    "- In Bayesian frameworks, there may be some prior expectations of who is on the phone or in person, which would be due to things like planning a meeting, caller ID, or having regular meetings with this person. This would form a prior expectation of who is on the phone. For simplicity to compare across the conditions, we will assume there is no expectation of meeting/calling this person, making a uniform prior. Therefore, to make our perceptual inference, which can be thought of as our posterior distribution, it would solely rely on our sensory information we receive, which can be though to as as likelihood. The uncertainty of calling someone is quite high (assuming no caller ID), as it would just be based on our voice (which would be distorted slightly over the phone). Therefore, adding the extra information of introducing yourself would increase the amount of information that can be used in our final perceptual estimate, which would reduce the uncertainty. Whereas, the uncertainty in the visual information of seeing someone would be quite low, making our final perceptuial estimate relatively easy and accurate (unless the person has a twin, then it may still be uncertain).\n",
    "\n",
    "**As prior information**\n",
    "- We can also easily reframe this problem to consider that the visual information of seeing the person before they speek acts as prior information. In this scenario the visual information provides a strong prior towards who the person is and when they speak (likelihood based on auditory cue) to us it confirms our prior expectation (narrow posterior which would be similar to the prior). In theory, we can also consider the introduction on the phone as providing the receiver with prior information about who they are going to have a phone call with, making the final pereptual estimate easy once the phone call begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall**\n",
    "- Regardless of how we consider the introduction to be used, the end result is a narrowing (less uncertain) posterior estimate (either based on a narrow likelhihood function or a narrow prior). This would result in a perceptual estimate with low levels of noise.\n",

    "**A research article entitled “The Easter bunny in October: Is it disguised as a duck?” explained that “Very little is known about the looks of the Easter bunny on his non-working days” [49]. To investigate, the authors showed an “ambiguous drawing of a duck/rabbit (unattributed from the October 23 1892 issue of Fliegende Blatter) . . . to. . . 265 subjects on Easter Sunday and to 276 different subjects on a Sunday in October of the same year.” The authors report: “Whereas on Easter the drawing was significantly more often recognized as a bunny, in October it was considered a bird by most subjects.” The drawing shown by the authors in their study was similar to the following (see textbook page):**\n",

    "- On easter Sunday, the participants would have a strong prior towards a bunny, as they have likely been seeing bunnies everywhere lately.
