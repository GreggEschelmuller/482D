    "- 5.6 (hint for part d: the absolute value of w for which the variance is minimal will depend on the relative magnitudes of $sigma_1$ and $sigma_2$; however, the general solution for the optimal w can be defined strictly in terms of $sigma_1$ and $sigma_2$. Try different values of sigma1 and sigma2 to get some intuition. For calculus fans, you can also derive an analytical solution, but this is not required.)  \n",

    "a. False. They are assumed to be conditionally independent, not completley independent.   \n",

    "**This problem builds on Section 5.5 about evidence accumulation. An observer infers a stimulus s from a sequence of measurements, $x_{obs,1}$, $x_{obs,2}$, . . . , $x_{obs,T}$, made on a single trial. The stimulus distribution is Gaussian with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma_s^2$ . The distribution of the $t^{th}$ measurement, $p(x_t|s)$, is Gaussian with mean s and variance $\\sigma_s$ (identical for all measurements); we assume conditional independence.**  "
